# Fire Extinguisher
Fire Extinguisher prevents data leaks after your "firewall"/system security is broken. When an attacker breaks into your system, they might try to exfiltrate data. By watching for a specific "canary" file to be accessed, you can automatically fire an alert and shut the host down to prevent damage.

# About Developer
